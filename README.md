The `readme_consultant` is a CLI tool that uses local LLMs to **analyze, improve and even rewrite your GitHub README.md** which can greatly improve communication.

## Why this exists?
A common pain point for developers â€” including myself â€” is writing clear, professional README.md files. I have often found it frustrating to organize my own notes and documentation effectively. While tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are incredibly helpful for improving clarity and tone, I am cautious about using them for private repositories since they involve copy-pasting sensitive content into cloud-based platforms.

Thatâ€™s why I built `readme_consultant` â€” a local LLM-powered tool that improves your README without ever sending data over the internet. It combines the power of language models with the privacy of offline tools.


## Features

- Reviews your `README.md` and gives structured feedback.
- Uses `Ollama` to run local LLMs like `llama3` so everything is offline.
- Able to generate an improved README from your existing one.
- Intuitive and easy to use.

## Setup

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mujasoft/readme_consultant.git
cd readme_consultant

# install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> Requires: Python 3.9+, `ollama` running locally and models like `llama3` downloaded.

---

## Usage

### Review Mode

Get AI feedback on your current `README.md`:

```bash
python3 readme_consultant.py review -r /path/to/your/repo -o output.txt
```

### Enhanced README Generation

Generate a rewritten, improved `README.md`:

```bash
python3 readme_consultant.py generate-enhanced-readme -r /path/to/your/repo -o output_readme.md
```

---

## How It Works

- Feeds the README and metadata to a local LLM (via `ollama`)
- Asks for improvements in clarity, structure, and professionalism
- Displays a rich summary of changes and writes output to file

## Limitations
- LLMs can still make mistakes and/or hallucinate.
- User's repository must have an existing `README.md` file.
- Currently only tested on MacOS and on a M1 Macbook Pro with 16GB RAM.
